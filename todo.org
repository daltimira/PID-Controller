- Build PID controller.
- Calculate steering angle. 
- Tune PID parameters.
- The vehicle should be able to drive successfuly.
- Write reflection portion.

- Steer in proportional to the cross track error.

1 - Set all gains to zero.
2 - Increase the P gain until the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
3 - Increase the D gain until the the oscillations go away (i.e. itâ€™s critically damped).
4 - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until increasing the D gain does not stop the oscillations.
5 - Set P and D to the last stable values.
6 - Increase the I gain until it brings you to the setpoint with the number of oscillations desired
